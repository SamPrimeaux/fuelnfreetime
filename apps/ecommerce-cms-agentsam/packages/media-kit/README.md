# @inneranimalmedia/media-kit

Provider-neutral media primitives for reusable CMS/admin applications.

## Design guarantees

- Storage/source, transforms, and delivery are separate capabilities.
- No vendor is mandatory. R2-only, Cloudflare Images-only, Drive-backed, local, or composed deployments are valid.
- Browser preview presets are presentation intent; they do **not** imply a paid transform or materialized derivative.
- Originals are identities/sources. Derivatives and delivery versions are separate concerns.
- Albums, galleries, campaigns, and product collections are organizational/presentation contracts, not storage folders.
- The package contains no customer branding, customer domains, bucket names, or customer-specific routes.

The application provides persistence, provider adapters, authorization, and rendering shells.
